# Data-structures
A glance to all the basic data structures, and these data structures are executed using c++ programming language. The data structures include :
* Stack
* Queue
<br/>

**1. Stack :**

A linear data structure which is based on the LIFO (Last In First Out) algorithm, to brief it, the last element in the array is the first to be removed. In real life application, consider a stack of plates vertically where the last plate which is on the top is the first to be removed, this is how stack works. Stack has two keywords namely Push and Pop, which means if any element is to be inserted in the stack then it is the push operation and if the top most element is to be removed it is known as the pop operation. 

Considering the program, it consists of a class stack and public variables top and a, here we are going to implement stack using array. Addition to that many other functions are declared to the class stack. The _*isfull()*_ function is used to return true or false if the stack is full, the same goes to the _*isempty()*_ function. *_peek()*_ function is used to display the topmost element of the stack if the stack is not empty, *_push()*_ function takes an integer as an parameter, which is to be pushed into the stack based on a condition, if the stack is not empty. *_pop()*_ function is used to remove the top most element of the stack and the _*getdata()*_ function is the initial declaration of the array.
